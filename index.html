                                    I'm a game developer from Wisconsin. 
                                    Since high school, I've always enjoyed 
                                    working on projects involving computer 
                                    work, including video development. I've 
                                    enjoyed playing video games ever since I 
                                    was a jit, so as I began to reach the end 
                                    of my high school career I decided that I 
                                    wanted to pursue video game development. I 
                                    enjoy anything programming, but I've mainly 
                                    been working on AI development and backend 
                                    systems.
