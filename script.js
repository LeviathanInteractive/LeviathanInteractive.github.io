        title: "Why We're Making Dread Not",
        author: "Sarah Ziebarth",
        content: `The water is dark and incredibly cold. The pressure is intense, and the stakes couldn’t be higher... <br> <br> 
        After being attacked by a colossal sea creature, a small nuclear submarine outfitted for research is thrown into a high-stakes 
        battle and must reach the surface before air runs out. Players take on the role of either the Pilot or the Mechanic and must work 
        together to keep the submarine stable by communicating with each other, fixing failing systems, and navigating through perilous waters. 
        Survival depends on the pair’s ability to work together under immense pressure. Failure is not an option. <br> <br> Dread Not is a virtual 
        reality/PC asymmetric co-op game created by Leviathan Interactive, a studio comprised of 15 UW-Stout students, whose mission is to unite people 
        through games! You play as a pair of marine researchers aboard a doomed vessel that has suffered severe damage and only has 10 minutes before running out of oxygen. 
        Your only chance of reaching the surface is by making emergency repairs, which are completed through cooperative and individual puzzles scattered throughout the 
        system rooms of the submarine. The Pilot, who can be played on either PC or in VR, is constrained to a single room where they control navigation and relay 
        information to the Mechanic in order to keep necessary systems up and running. Alternatively, the Mechanic, played only on PC, is able to move between all 
        other rooms and must repair systems under the Pilot's guidance. This game is all about communication and cooperation. In a world that’s increasingly 
        connected, inspiring people to reach out and work with each other is great motivation for our team. We believe that by creating a game that not only 
        brings people together, but literally requires two to play, we can gradually make the world a better and more entertaining place. <br> <br> Generating a fun, 
        yet semi-chaotic atmosphere for players that allows them to really feel the tension of the situation was also key to the idea of this game, and what better way 
        to do that than have both players be in completely different roles with simple, yet interconnected tasks. This is what led our team to implement both PC and 
        VR; we wanted to enhance that asymmetric experience by having two distinct modes of immersion and additionally add another layer of interactivity to the 
        gameplay of the Pilot. Transporting the more stationary role of the two into the environment in such a way that allows them to feel as though they’re 
        actually there helps intensify and incorporate action into an experience that otherwise doesn’t provide much space to explore. However, there is still PC 
        compatibility for the Pilot available for players who prefer a traditional platform, seeing as getting the game into as many hands as possible was another 
        team goal of ours. <br> <br> Needless to say, with inspirations taken from real 1960’s Navy Nuclear Ballistic Missile submarines of the George Washington 
        Class combined with the 80's vibes found in cinematic classics such as The Hunt for Red October and Jaws, Dread Not is sure to be an absolute blast for players 
        of all ages. Will you sync or swim? `

        title: "Chaos in Deep Waters",
        author: "Eleanor Berg",
        content: `Deep beneath the water’s surface, under hundreds of tons of pressure, at the depth 
        the furthest rays of the sun can’t reach is where the crew members of 
        this beaten-up tin can of a submarine find themselves. If they fail to keep the machine functioning, 
        they will be flattened in an instant by the unwavering pressure of the sea. 
        <br><br>
        The Mechanic sprints haphazardly through the submarine, their footsteps drowned out by the piercing alarms. 
        They shout, their voice echoing through the metal hull, but the target of their frustration simply turns down 
        the radio’s volume. The Pilot and the Mechanic are arguing. The Pilot, stuck in the cockpit, pours even more 
        coffee into their "World's Best Submarine Pilot” mug with shaking hands. The sonar pings echo off the steel walls. 
        Something is outside the submarine. The Pilot doesn’t notice, they are screaming through the comms system at the Mechanic, 
        who just said something very rude about the Pilot. Something in the deep dark grows nearer, unseen and unheard. 
        The submarine creaks as the clock ticks down. Water bursts out from a pipe behind a fish-themed motivational poster 
        in the kitchen. The Mechanic can’t understand the Pilot’s directions. The Pilot can’t nderstand the submarine’s user 
        manual. If they don’t communicate efficiently and work together, they will both die, and probably also get fired.
        <br><br>
        Despite the inherent horror the open ocean provides, Dread Not is not meant to be a dark and serious game. 
        We want panic, we want some fear, but communication between the two players is the main priority. What is 
        needed is some lightheartedness and humor to encourage the players to interact and fight playfully with 
        each other. We wanted to make the world around the ship dark yet sublimely beautiful in addition to having 
        a fun, stressful but not overly so, energy-filled game. The juxtaposition of those two ideas made actualizing 
        the atmosphere a bit of a struggle. 
        <br><br>
        We spent a long time in predevelopment trying to nail down consistent mood and aesthetics through concept art 
        and having watch parties of theme-related movies. Making the game pretty was straightforward: prioritizing mood 
        lighting, god rays, pops of color, particle effects, and extra windows to watch the schools of fish– or to 
        watch out for whatever is lurking in the dark. However, getting the general mood right was much harder. On 
        one hand, we want the player to feel stressed, panicked, and maybe frustrated, but we also want them to enjoy 
        the game instead of rage-quitting. We decided an effective way to give the players a break from the panic was to 
        have environmental assets tell a story, not of seriousness and horror, but of cynical, overworked employees and 
        an absurd, out of touch corporation. Many props were included with the sole purpose of forcing players to break 
        out of their frustration. We determined that adding some absurdity to the game helped players relax and get more 
        fun out of the struggle. Eventually we got the mood nailed down in concept, and now all that is left is to make 
        it a reality.

        title: "THe World of Dread Not",
        author: "Gabe Anderson",
        content: `The ocean – what a wonderful, diverse, horrifying place to go. Well, you’ve been sent down in a rickety 
        ole’ submarine to research a possible new species. Of course, you’re also needed to collect some extravagant 
        goods for your partner company and expedition funder, Sienna Allure. Sienna is a rising multinational conglomerate 
        hell bent on delivering quality luxury products to its customers. Their newest hit product is a perfume made from a 
        kind of ambergris originating from an undiscovered species that seemingly comes from an unexplored region of the ocean. 
        The group of researchers responsible for the discovery are dying to prove this is a new species after all. To get funding 
        and a capable submarine, they agreed to work with Sienna Allure… a deal with the devil. 
        <br><br>
        Cordelia, the submarine the players are on, is a 1960’s era United States nuclear powered George Washington. Sienna 
        Allure was able to make this lucrative purchase because the government deemed it unsalvageable and useless. 
        Luckily, Sienna Allure has also deemed you expendable! The Cordelia is an amalgamation of parts that barely 
        function together; some components have been appropriately updated to 1980’s technology, while others are stuck 
        in the past. Not to mention that undiscovered creature, Charlie, will make his presence known. He isn’t too happy 
        with your intrusion on his turf. 
        <br><br>
        The narrative in Dread Not is driven primarily by captivating environments and immersive audio. We incorporate dynamic 
        lighting affected by the environment and creatures, decals and logos plastered on the walls and equipment, 
        in addition with incredible 80’s themed music to bring it all to life. While your employers may not have your 
        well-being in mind, the automated voice onboard certainly does, though it may not always be too helpful. All the 
        world building is to help contrast suspense and humor; making a more chaotic scenario for the players to work through
